# ShiftScheduleManager - v0.0.1
When organizing all shifts for any size of event it can quickly get very complicated balancing out when, with whom and how often people work during the whole event and so on. It especially gets almost impossible to manage when you offered to try to integrate some personal requests like "I want to work with B" or "I can only work Tuesday night".

This tool will take care of those problems and on top of that provide an as-custom-as-possible experience to allow for (hopefully) the most niche of cases our there.

## Important
This is a side project and will be developed in my free time. If you are in need of such a tool hit me up, with the proper motivation this can surely be done in far less time then it will take me :).
